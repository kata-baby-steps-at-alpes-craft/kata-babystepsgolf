## Session Information

### Topic

_The goal of this kata is to practice updating working software with the smallest number of baby steps possible!_

### Focus Points

- Understanding what we call a "baby step"
- Awareness that baby steps have names
- Understanding the difference between Refactoring (that preserve behaviour) and Transformative (that change behaviour) baby steps.
- Learning to separate 'design' and 'feature' work
- Understand how baby-steps support continuous refactoring within user stories
- Understand how baby-steps support user story splitting that maximizes early value delivery
- Tidy First

### Style & Duration

This kata is best played like a golf track. It consists of 3 "holes", which are features to add to existing working software.
Like golf holes, each feature has a 'par': a typical number of baby steps it can be implemented with. 
You might do better than the par, or worse. You can replay a hole to reduce your number of baby steps.
Using TCR helps us to keep track of the number of baby steps.

You can practice using either of these styles:

- 2-hour [Prepared Kata](doc/PreparedKata.md)
- 2-hour [Randori in Pairs](doc/RandoriInPairs.md)
- 2-hour [Randori Kata](doc/RandoriKata.md)
- 2-hour [Mob Kata](doc/MobProgramming.md)

### TCR and Tidy First

This kata works better with TCR, as it takes care of running the tests at every small changes and commits everytime tests are passing.
If pairs also push using TCR on their own branch, the facilitator can even keep track of their progress and create a leaderboard!

As TCR reverts any change that fails a test, we have to make sure the code to pass a new test is minimal. 
That's why TCR goes hand in hand with the Tidy First flow. It's a small twist to the TDD cycle:

1. Add (or enable, or uncomment) a test, save
2. TCR runs:
3. If the tests pass, TCR commits
4. Otherwise, TCR reverts the code
   - You should have learned what is needed to pass the tests
   - Re-disable the failing test to get back to green (this is a current limitation of the TCR tool, which only reverts the code, without the test)
   - _Make the change easy_: through baby-steps, prepare the code to pass the test
   - _Do the easy change_: re-enable the test, with everything ready, you should be able to make the small code changes required to pass the test
   - As you save, TCR will run again
   - Depending on the tests result, Go back to 3. or 4.

### Holes

#### 1: Pascal Triangle

- **User Story**: As a math geek, I want to make the triangle display isosceles, so that it looks more like the traditional image we have of Pascal's Triangle
- **Difficulty**: TODO
- **Par**: 14
- **SPIDR Story Splitting by**: INTERFACES, baby steps programming let us safely postpone improvements to the display, while letting users enjoy a working yet minimalistic display early
- **Attention Point**:
  - We are using the Strangler pattern to change the display while keeping everything working. "legacy" code is prefixed and marked as @Deprecated. We will need to delete it at the end.
  - We prepared new tests that are marked @Disabled
  - Facilitator will demo the beginning to show what baby-steps golf looks like, how to use TCR, and Tidy First. It also makes the exercise easier.
  - Introducing 'identity' function or operations are a nice way to make code emerge 

#### 2: FizzBuzz

- **User Story**: As a birthday party organizer, I want to add "Bazz" for multiples of 7, so that I have a more difficult game for experienced FizzBuzz players
- **Difficulty**: TODO
- **Par**: 22 (or only 10 if we do not count every branch separately)
- **SPIDR Story Splitting by**: RULES, baby steps programming let us safely postpone more advanced rules, while letting players enjoy a working fun game early
- **Attention Point**:
  - Introduce an accumulator

#### 3: Numbers to LCD

- **User Story**: As a giant display panel operator, I need to specify a size for the LCD display, so that I can display details in small text
- **Difficulty**: TODO
- **Par**: TODO
- **SPIDR Story Splitting by**: DATA, baby steps programming let us safely postpone the less used cases, while letting users use a working display on the most frequent input early
- **Attention Point**:
  - TODO
